    <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup cold buttermilk</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease 10-in skillet. 
        Line with parchment paper</li>
    <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt for shortcake together
        in a large mixing bowl. Whisk buttermilk, egg yolk, and vanilla
        together in a glass measuring cup until evenly combined; set aside.
    </li>
    <li>Scatter the butter pieces over the flour mixture. Use a rubbing 
        motion with your fingertips and cut the butter into the flour 
        mixture to distribute. Create a well in the center of the flour
        mixture. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the center of the well.
        Use a rubber spatula to mix the flour into the buttermilk 
        mixture to form a moist, shaggy dough.

    <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared skillet. Smooth the dough to
        distribute evenly in the pan. 
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and baked through,
        25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.
